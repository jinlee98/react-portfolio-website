                    • Designed, implemented, tested, and deployed a full-stack project for the Middle Mile team which provides visibility
into planning entities and save Amazon hundreds of dollars each month in working-hours. Fully documented. <br></br>
• Intuitive front end web app displaying, filtering, and querying planning entities which used to be manually found
from logs - using TypeScript, React, Amazon Katal, S3, Cloudfront to use a serverless architecture, caching data on
user edge servers, resulting in very fast load and cache times. Tested with React testing library, Jest, and Enzyme <br></br>
• Back end infrastructure also using serverless architecture using DynamoDB database, Amazon Honeycomb and
Java to implement file ingestion, event ingestion, and querying API for the front end.
